\toguide{What is it in simple terms (title)?}
\toguide{Why should anyone care?}
\toguide{What was my contribution?} 
\toguide{What you are doing in each section (a sentence or two per section)}

Tip: if it's hard for you to start writing, then try to split it to smaller parts, e.g. if the title is ``Type Inference for a Cryptographic Protocol Prover Tool'' then the ``What is it'' can be divided into ``what is type inference'', ``what is cryptographic protocol'' and ``what is the prover tool''. These three can also be split to smaller parts etc.
