\begin{document}

One of the key challenges for static analysers based on the abstract interpretation is to choose abstract domains in a way that minimizes the loss
of precision stemming from over-approximation.
The loss of precision causes static analysers to emit false-positives and it is clear
that even if one can guarantee the soundness of the underlying analysis, there is a threshold of incorrect warnings above which the results of the analysis contain too much noise to be helpful to the end user.

We will now introduce two analyses that, when combined with other analyses, help to increase the precision of a static analyser that detects data races.
Both of these analyses are implemented in the static analyser of \textit{Goblint} that we will discuss further in the next section.

\toguide{Okay, what is the point of it?}

\subsection{The Original Region Analysis}

First of the analyses is the \textit{region analysis}. The key idea behind this analysis is to try to partition the memory used by the program under analysis into disjoint regions. Based on this information we can deduce that memory accesses to different regions cannot data race.
This does not exclude the possibility of a data race inside a region, but it means that for every region there can be a separate locking mechanism.

As an example, consider a hash table using chaining to handle hash collisions that has a lock for each of the buckets.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \foreach \y in {0,...,5}
      {
        \draw[->, dashed] (-2,5.5 - \y) node [black, anchor =  east] {$L_{\y}$} -- (0,5.5- \y);
        \draw[thick]  (0,5 - \y) rectangle  ++(1,1) node[midway] {$B_{\y}$};
        \draw[->, thick] (1,5 - \y + 0.5) -- ++(0.5,0);
        \foreach \x in {1,...,5}
        {
          \draw (1.5*\x, 5 -\y+0.2) rectangle ++(0.6,0.6);

        }
        \foreach \x in {1,...,4}
        {
          \draw[->] (1.5*\x + 0.3, 5 - \y + 0.8) to [bend left=45] ++(1.5,0);
        }
      }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Separate chaining hash table with each bucket being protected by a lock} 
\end{figure}

If the hashes of the keys $k_1$ and $k_2$ are different, then accessing them in the hash table cannot cause a data race.
On the other hand, if $k_1$ and $k_3$ produce the same hash, then there is a real risk of a data race and Goblint cannot exclude this possiblity without further information.
It would be enough to know that in both cases, the lock protecting bucket corresponding to this hash was held during the access.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \foreach \y in {0,...,5}
      {
        \draw[->, dashed] (-2,5.5 - \y) node [black, anchor =  east] {$L_{\y}$} -- (0,5.5- \y);

        }
        \foreach \x in {1,...,4}
        {
          \draw[->] (1.5*\x + 0.3, 5 - \y + 0.8) to [bend left=45] ++(1.5,0);
        }
      }
    \draw[red, ->, shorten >= 5pt, thick] (-3,3) node [black, anchor =  east] {$H\lp k_3 \rp$} -- (0,3.5);
    \draw[red, ->, shorten >= 5pt, thick] (-3,1) node [black, anchor =  east] {$H\lp k_2 \rp$} -- (0,0.5); 
    \draw[red, ->, shorten >= 5pt, thick] (-3,4) node [black, anchor =  east] {$H\lp k_1 \rp$} -- (0,3.5);
      
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Separate chaining hash table} 
\end{figure}


If we can guarantee that when adding an element for key $k_1$ and for key $k_3$,
we are accessing different regions of the memory, then we can deduce that these additions cannot cause a data race.

For a hash table, the most obvious partition for the regions would be to separate the buckets of the hash table.
This can be done if we can guarantee that the same memory location is not accesible from different buckets.

\subsection{Regions in Time}

Device drivers contain not only disjoint regions of memory, but also disjoint time intervals.

\toguide{How can you use happen-before here?}

Consider the following simplified device driver:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=c,style=def]

static int i = 0;
static int j = 0;

static int file_open(file* f, ...)
{
    printk( "Opening device \n");
    file -> private_data += 1;
    j += 1;
    return 0;
}

static int file_close(file* f, ...)
{
    printk( "Closing device \n");
    file -> private_data -= 1
    j -= 1;
    return 0;
}

int a(file f, ...)
{
  j += 1;
  return 0;
}

int b(file f, ...)
{
  j += 1
  return 0;
}

struct file_operations f_ops = {
  .open    = file_open,
  .release = file_close,
};

int init(...)
{
  publish_file_operations(f_ops);
  i += 1;
  return 0;
}

int exit(...)
{
  i -= 1;
  return 0;
}

\end{lstlisting}

As mentioned previously, \inlinecode{init} and \inlinecode{exit} functions are used by the kernel to register and deregister a device.
After publishing the file operations we can no longer assume that the functions of the driver are called by only one thread and
hence the static analyser should detect a possible data-race (given there is no additional information) between the operations on the variable $i$ in functions \inlinecode{init} and \inlinecode{exit}. 
At same time, the Linux kernel does not allow a call to the \inlinecode{exit} function until the call to the \inlinecode{init} function has completed and all the opened files are released.

Our aim is to have an analysis that knows about such guarantees and can make use of the information the guarantees provide.
%
%\toguide{Example makes sense, but how to practically make use of it?}
%
To do so, inspired by the happens-before relation,  we extend the region analysis to cover time in addition to space.
%
%\toguide{Erghh, was not the easiest part of the Goblint section. A bit of refreshment would be great.}
%
Let the example driver have two memory regions, $A$ and $B$, and let \inlinecode{i} belong to the region $A$ and \inlinecode{j} to the region $B$.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[thick,-] (0,0,0)  -- ++(0,0,\cubez) --  node [anchor = north] {$A$} ++(0.5*\cubex,0,0) -- node [anchor = north] {$B$} ++(0.5*\cubex,0,0)   --  ++(0,0,-\cubez) -- ++(-\cubex,0,0);
      \draw[thick,dashed] (0.5*\cubex,0,0) -- ++(0,0,\cubez);
      \fill[opacity=\opacity,red!30,draw=black,xzp=0] (0,0) rectangle (2.5,5);
      \fill[opacity=\opacity,red!75,draw=black,xzp=0] (2.5,0) rectangle (5,5);

      \node at (0.25*\cubex,0,0.35*\cubez) (i) {\figcode{i}};
      \node at (0.65*\cubex,0,0.4*\cubez) (j) {\figcode{j}};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Memory partition for the example driver as done by region analysis}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, this does not allow us to eliminate the data race between the assignments to \inlinecode{i} in \inlinecode{init} and \inlinecode{exit} functions.
However, if we would enhance the region analysis with an additional dimension that would roughly correspond to time,
we could divide the memory as seen on the following illustration. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}

      \drawcubeoverz{0}{0}{0.5*\cubex}{0.5*\cubey}{\initLColor}
      
      \drawcubeoverz{0}{0.5*\cubey}{0.5*\cubex}{\cubey}{\postInitLColor}

      \drawcubeoverz{0.5*\cubex}{0}{\cubex}{0.5*\cubey}{\initRColor}      

      \drawcubeoverz{0.5*\cubex}{0.5*\cubey}{\cubex}{\cubey}{\postInitRColor}

      \drawoutercube

      \node at (0.285*\cubex,0.15*\cubey,0.7*\cubez) (ip) {\figsubcode{i}{init}};
      \node at (0.285*\cubex,0.8*\cubey,0.7*\cubez) (i) {\figsubcode{i}{exit}};

      \draw[thick,-] (0,0,\cubez) -- node[anchor= east] {$\mathword{init}$} ++(0,0.5*\cubey,0)  -- node[anchor= east] {$\mathword{postInit}$}  ++(0,0.5*\cubey,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Memory partition with addition of time dimension}
\end{figure}

Here, $\mathword{init}$ and $\mathword{postInit}$ are both \textit{time regions}.
%
This lets us exclude the possibility of race between these two stamements. 
%
%\toguide{How is it done?}

To do this more generally, we need to consider the information that we track for
each read and write access.
%
We will divide the tracked information into the \textit{left} and \textit{right}
side of an implication: if two accesses may collide, then certain safety conditions
must hold to avoid a race condition.
%
On the left side, information regarding the region of the statement is stored as a set of sets, $C$,
such that every element $I \in C$ describes an intersection of regions. This
allows an extensible and modular framework, such that we can add an analysis to
provide a different means of partitioning accesses without being concerned
with the already existing ones. 

Conceptually, every element of $C$ describes a possible region for the access. So if we know that the set $C$ for $x_{a}$ is in
   
\begin{equation*}
\lb \lb A, \mathword{init} \rb, \lb B, \mathword{postInit} \rb \rb 
\end{equation*}

then we can say that the statement is either located in region $A$ and region $\mathword{init}$ or in region $B$ and region $\mathword{postInit}$. 

In our example driver, the $C$ for the increment statement of $i$ in the $init$ function would be 

\begin{equation*}
\lb \lb A, init \rb \rb \text{.}
\end{equation*} 

On the right side, information regarding possible reasons about why a data race cannot take place with another read or write statement is stored in a set $M$.
For example, $M$ could contain the set of locks held at the time the statement is executed or information about the guaranteed uniqueness of the thread running the procedure that contains the statement.

When deciding on the possibility of a data race between statements $a$ and $b$, we use two predicates, $L$ and $R$ to evaluate left and right sides of these statements. 

\kalmer{see L ja R on ikka jube segane}
\todisc{Parem?}

The first of these predicates, $L$, is true if it is possible that the statements share the same region. It is defined as follows:

\begin{equation*}
L \lp C_a, C_b \rp = \exists I \in C_a,\, \exists J \in C_B  \lp I \subseteq J \lor J \subseteq I \rp \text{.}
\end{equation*}

If $L \lp C_a, C_b \rp$ evaluates to false, it means that the two statements cannot share a common region and hence there cannot be a data race. 

The second predicate, $R$ evaluates the sets $M_a$ and $M_b$ and returns true if there is something that guarantees that the statements $a$ and $b$ cannot race.
For example, it could be when performing both of these statements, lock $l$ must be held or in case of $a=b$,
there is a guarantee that there can be only one thread running that executes the statement.

Equipped with those definitions, we can guarantee that statements $a$ and $b$
cannot race if the following implication holds.
\begin{equation}
\label{implication}
L \lp C_a, C_b \rp \implies R \lp M_a, M_b \rp  
\end{equation}
%See on sul ikka väga halb harjumus displayed asju lausete keskel toppida!

Returning to our example driver, one can see that using the enhanced region analysis, there cannot be a race between $i_{init}$ and $i_{exit}$.
Indeed, as

\begin{equation*}
 \lb \lb A, init \rb \rb \cap  \lb \lb A, postInit \rb \rb = \emptyset
\end{equation*}

then $L \lp C_{i_{init}}, C_{i_{postInit}} \rp$ is false and the implication (\ref{implication}) holds for $i_{init}$ and $i_{exit}$.

As an example of right-hand sides excluding a data race, if we take both $a$ and $b$ to be $i_{init}$, then when evaluating 

\begin{equation*}
R \lp M_{i_{init}}, M_{i_{init}} \rp
\end{equation*} 

we can take into account that the Linux kernel does not allow one to register the same driver more than once and as such,
we can guarantee that the thread running the $init$ function is unique.

Based on that information $R \lp M_{i_{init}}, M_{i_{init}} \rp$ holds and so does the implication (\ref{implication}).

\toguide{Does this thing scale, anything else you can do other than init/exit?}

One might have noticed that our example drivers have two extra functions, $a$ and $b$. Let's now suppose that a similar property holds for $a$ and $b$. During the lifetime of the driver, we can only call $a$ once and $b$ once and the call to $a$  must happen before the call to $b$.

Let the following be the regions of the program, enhanced with the extra dimension, taking into account only the division by $a$ and $b$.

If we want to combine this time division with the one we had for functions \inlinecode{init} and \inlinecode{exit}, we could find the Cartesian product of the two and use elements of that set as time regions. The resulting partition is shown in the next figure.

Here, the set $C$ for the increment statement of $i$ in the $\mathword{init}$ function would be

and for the decrement statement of $j$ in $b$ it would be

\begin{equation*}
\lb \lb B, \lp \mathword{init}, b \rp  \rb, \lb B, \lp \mathword{postInit}, b \rp \rb \rb \text{.}
\end{equation*}

\toguide{Wait, this does not really scale, does it?}

It is easy to see that this approach does not scale too well -- in the worst case the computational difficulty will grow exponentially
with each component of the Cartesian product that form the time partition.

However, notice that when we evaluate the left sides of the two statements, the
time dimension only has an effect if memory regions of the statements overlap;
if the memory regions are disjoint, the predicate $L$ is already false.

%\forall \lp c_1, c_2 \rp, c_1 \in C_{i_a} , c_2 \in C_{i_b} , \lnot \lp \exists m \in \mathword{Mem},  m \in c_1 \land m \in c_2 \rp
%\end{equation*} 
%
%and as at same time, all the entries of the left-hand side must contain a memory region, then it is clear that $\lnot L \lp C_{i_{a}}, C_{i_{b}} \rp $. 
%
With that in mind, we can construct the time regions for the memory region $A$ by combining only the relevant time partitions for the variables in the region $A$. 
For our running example, the partition would look as follows.

      \draw[thick,-] (0,0,\cubez) -- node[anchor= east] {$\mathword{init}$} ++(0,0.5*\cubey,0)  -- node[anchor= east] {$\mathword{postInit}$}  ++(0,0.5*\cubey,0);
      \draw[thick,-] (\cubex,0,0) -- node[anchor= west] {$\mathword{default}$} (\cubex,\defaultH*\cubey,0) -- node[anchor= west] {$a$}  (\cubex,\aH*\cubey,0)  --
      node[anchor= west] {$b$}  (\cubex,\bH*\cubey,0) -- node[anchor= west] {$\mathword{default}$} (\cubex,\cubey,0);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Memory partition with local time partition.}
\end{figure}

With this partition, the set $C$ for the increment statement of $i$ in the $init$ function would be

\begin{equation*}
\lb \lb A, \mathword{init} \rb \rb
\end{equation*}

and for the decrement statement of $j$ in $b$ it would be

\begin{equation*}
\lb \lb B,  b \rb \rb \text{.}
\end{equation*}


This approach scales well if we are able to divide memory into small areas.
%
%
%\toguide{Okay, neat, solves the scaling issue. That is it?}
%
More importantly, the finer granularity of this approach lets us support more specific guarantees.
%
Once again, let's consider the functions \inlinecode{file\_open} and \inlinecode{file\_release} of the example driver we have used in this section.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c,style=def]
static int file_open(file* f, ...)
{
    printk( "Opening device \n");
    file -> private_data += 1;
    j += 1;
    return 0;
}

static int file_release(file* f, ...)
{
    printk( "Closing device \n");
    file -> private_data -= 1
    j -= 1;
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

It is guaranteed that the file $f$ can only be closed once for each time it is opened and the operations have to alternate. This means that the operations on \inlinecode{file -> private\_data}
cannot race in functions \inlinecode{file\_open} and \inlinecode{file\_release}. At the same time, it is very possible that there is a race between the operations on \inlinecode{j} in \inlinecode{file\_open} and \inlinecode{file\_release}
-- it is possible that the file $f_1$ is being opened at same time as $f_2$ is being closed. 

If we are able to separate the memory region that only contains \inlinecode{file}, then we can partition this further by dividing the time dimension to $\mathword{default}$, $\mathword{file\_open}$ and $\mathword{file\_release}$,
while not applying the same division of time dimension to the memory region that contains \inlinecode{j}.
